# iv-Open-Quantum-System
Quantum Systems are the physical assembly of some microscopic objects whose behvaiour can be understood only by solving the Schrodinger's wave equation.
Usually quantum systems studied are idealisation of some real systems and are taken as isolated from the environment.
Open quantum systems are the quatum systems which are open to the influences of and interactions with the environment and thus show decoherence and a few other important phoenomena.
All real quantum systems are open in general.
